            <p>I have to push the pram a lot. Well, I got better. The nose? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
            <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. <strong> Shh!</strong> <em> Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.</em> Let us ride to Camelot!</p>
            <h2>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</h2>
            <p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. The nose?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Well, what do you want?</li>
                <li>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</li>
                <li>I have to push the pram a lot.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</h3>
            <p>Where'd you get the coconuts? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>

                <li>Well, I got better.</li>

            <p>Why? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
            <p>Did you dress her up like this? What do you mean? Shut up! Will you shut up?! Bloody Peasant!</p>
            <p>We found them. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. We want a shrubbery!! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.

            <p>Look, my liege! What a strange person. He hasn't got shit all over him. We want a shrubbery!!</p>
            <p>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, we did do the nose.</p>
            <p>I have to push the pram a lot. A newt? Shut up! Will you shut up?! The nose?</p>
            <p>And the hat. She's a witch! And the hat. She's a witch! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction!
